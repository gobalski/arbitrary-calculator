* Arbitrary Calculator
This is a Commandline Interface to use the GreatBin Library I created, which is a crude implementation of arbitrary precision arithmetic.
** Functionality
Using GreatBin in the back. But display decimal numbers.

 - perform basic operation in a prompt (+,-,*,/)
   > 2 + 3
   > 5
 - call functions from the prompt
   > PI(prec)
   > 3.14...
 - save numbers in Variables
   > a = 234
 - change Display mode between GreatBin and dec

** Model-View-Controller Architecture
*** Model

Where the Variables are stored.
*** View
show a command prompt.
expect user input.
*** Controller
